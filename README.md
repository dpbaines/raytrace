# Raytracing Exercise

My attempt at making a 3D engine implementing raytracing. I intend to implement shaders and texturing in the future. Right now it uses SFML as an easy way of creating a GUI with a canvas. I don't use CUDA or GPU acceleration right now, but I will look into multithreading which seems very doable.

# Building

    cd build
    make

# Dependencies
* SFML
